**Learning Data Structures and Algorithms**

I am currently learning Data Structures and Algorithms from scratch. I am following Striver's DSA sheet, which is part of the comprehensive [Striver's A2Z DSA Course](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2).

**About the Course:**
- [Striver's A2Z DSA Course](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2) is a structured program designed to teach essential data structures and algorithms concepts. The course covers a wide range of topics essential for software development and competitive programming.

**Resources:**
- [Course Sheet 2](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2): This sheet contains a curated list of topics, problems, and solutions to guide your learning journey.

 **Progress:**
- Daily Goal: Solve at least two problems each day.
- Currently working through the DSA sheet to build a solid understanding of fundamental concepts.
- Regularly practicing problems and implementing algorithms to reinforce learning.
